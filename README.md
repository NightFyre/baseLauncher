# baseLauncher
Basic Process Launcher w/ Dll Injection Capabilities

**EXAMPLE USAGE**
> PATH: Direct Path to Game Executable  
> PARAMS: null (unless you have something specific in mind like "-insecure" for instance)  
> DLL: Direct Path to DLL  

If everything goes right the game should launch and your DLL should also be injected into the target process
